Welcome to LeeL Blog
====================


LeeL Blog allows you blog for free using Evernote ( [www.evernote.com](www.evernote.com) ) as your post editor and Github ( [www.github.com](www.github.com) ) as your website host. 


Using our blog template, you can create your new blog in seconds, without any programing knowledge nor hassle. 


You can choose to post in standard HTML or the well known Markdown syntax of formating.


If you are a designer or a programmer and would like fully customize your blog appearance, you can use the power of Github to track your modifications and work together with your team. 


Already have a Github page? No problem, LeeL Blog is able to post on existing Github pages, improving your post experience and reducing the time you use to maintain your site today.


Why would you pay for similar services like [www.postach.io](www.postach.io)  if you can have it for free and with more posting options?


Why would you pay for a host service like [www.wordpress.com](www.wordpress.com)  or opt to have storage limits and ads on your website if you can have it for free without any limitation and have your site hosted in a reliable company as Github?


If you are like us and believe that anyone should have the right to easily and freely disseminate ideas, give LeeL Blog a try!
